# Holiday Weather

Simple static site showing weather forecasts for popular holiday destinations. The homepage lists twenty destinations. Clicking a card opens a dedicated page with the 7‑day forecast loaded from the free [Open‑Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) API. Forecasts show the day of the week and include simple weather icons. Each destination page also features a vibrant hero image and an email signup form.

## Development
No build step is required. Open `index.html` in a browser or deploy the files to any static host.
